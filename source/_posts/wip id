TL;DR: Use HTML IDs for headers, avoid IDs everywhere else

## The problem

I read in many places to use HTML IDs and I see a lot of HTML with them too.

I basically never use IDs.

Here's why.

## When to use HTML IDs

### As semantic anchor names

IDs are **anchor names**. As such, they can be targeted in URLs. Here's an example: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/links.html#h-12.2.3

Note that w3.org, wikipedia, ..., all have IDs generated for the section headers in this way.

In summary, every section header **should** have an ID, and this ID should never change in the future, even if the content changes.

### When required to do so



## When to avoid them

### When they're not anchor names

The fact that IDs are anchor names also mean that any other IDs could be used as an anchor, or could conflict with a future anchor.

This is even more serious in single page apps which uses the anchor as a way to store the internal url (e.g. gmail).


### IDs must be unique

### IDs & CSS

People that know their CSS way more than I do appear to agree that IDs should not be used in CSS.
