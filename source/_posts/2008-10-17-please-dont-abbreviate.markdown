Abbreviation sucks. I'll add famous people that agree with me here when I get the time. And if I find any!

I dislike the fact that ruby's Time class as a `mon` method (c'mon!), but at least it is aliased by `month`. Now why oh why does ruby's Time class has a `min` method and no `minute` method? Same goes for `sec` vs `second`. At least `sec` isn't as ambiguous as `min`.

Can't stand `elsif` (wow! one less character! impressive gain...), `Enumerable.uniq`, ...

I'm counting on you to start a Facebook group "don't abbreviate in ruby"!
