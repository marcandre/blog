I'm always mesmerized as to why <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a> is considered the html/css reference. It just sucks.

For example, check out the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_class_position.asp">definition of `position: absolute`</a>. Shouldn't "its containing block" be "its containing <span style="font-weight: bold;">positionned</span> block"? Why is the example so simplistic as to be completely pointless?

Here's a <a href="http://stopdesign.com/articles/absolute/">much better explanation</a>.

Another <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/tag_object.asp">example</a>:

"The &lt;object&gt; tag is partially supported in all major browsers."

Geee, thanks. That sure helps a lot.
